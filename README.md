#AQATestTasks

I have a bit tired from endless similar tests tasks, 
which I need to anytime when I looking for a new job. That's why I will save it in this repository to reuse it in future.
If you enough skilled and understand how the code are working you can reuse it too ^.^

This is my test task for interview at company.
It have 3 parts:
1) Google test, that search some data , take the most exact result and then
open founded link in new tab
2) Google test, that search data and then select last hour results.
3) API test that make post request and check response

In this task uses TestNG, Selenide and REST assured Java libraries.
